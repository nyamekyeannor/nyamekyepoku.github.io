    <div class="abouttext">
        <p> My name is Nyamekye Annor, I'm passionate about Code, Music, and Food. But before we delve into my passions I would like to acknowledge the fact you 
            probably skipped over my first name or almost bit your tongue trying to pronounce it. Allow me to assist:
            <ul class="name">Nya - ña in  mañana</ul>
            <ul class="name">Me - as in mi in mistletoe</ul>
            <ul class="name">kye - as in "che" as in Chester</ul>
            now put it all together, ña-mi-che, Nyamekye! or you may just call me Chay. By this time I'm sure you're wondering about the origin and meaning 
            of my name. Well, Nyamekye derives from Ghana west African in the Twi dialect which literally means Gods gift. I'm sure you can imagine how special 
            I feel knowing when someone mentions my name they're referring to me as a gift from God.
        </p>

        <p> As early as I can remember music has always been apart of me. Something I can truly say God gifted me with. Growing up with a house full of musicians it 
            challenged me to cherish and carry the gift of music everywhere I went. I play drums, bass guitar, and keyboard so I guess you can call me a triple threat.
            I'm a firm believer in Christ and an owner at Antioch Waco where I serve on the worship team as a drummer. Having the privilege to lead people in worship 
            with like-minded people and see many transformed is something I hold dear to my heart and won't trade for the world. 
        </p>

        <P> Let's talk about my passion for food! Well, let me clarify by saying "Good food" made with love. Growing up in a big household my parents had to 
            prepared new, fresh meals almost every week. We would often invite other families and neighbors over for dinner and good music. Seeing the joy they
            had serving people and how it brought many together stirred in me the same passion. Fast forward years down the line Chay's scratch Kitchen was 
            birthed, where I cater meal preps but really enjoy hosting people to experience extraordinary food and music. Chay's Scratch Kitchen has catered to
            birthday parties, church picnic, and many more. Currently, because of my wife and I's big move to Texas Chays Scratch Kitchen has taken a hiatus and
            primarily post most home creations on Instagram in order to inspire many.
        </P>

        <p> It was January of 2019 where my pregnant wife at the time and I heard from God to move to Texas. A state where we've never been or have family. To 
            keep a long story short we moved to Texas July 5th 2019 with our two-year-old and four-month-old baby girl. Curently we live in Waco Texas enjoying 
            each season life brings our way. 
        </p>
